          We are team Hackers. We believe in providing a better business
          experience for the low level businesses. With 'Hawkers Hut' we are
          targeting the "Thelawalas" or simply the cart vendors who move around
          our locality selling their goods.
        </p>
        <p>
          This web app will help the customers connect with the vendors around
          them and get their location so that they can easily connect with them
          and buy from them. This will help both customers and the local cart
          vendors in numerous ways.
